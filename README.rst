**DISCLAIMER**

Those are my own programming assginment answers. If you are
studying the course and looking for a hint or suggestion for your current stuck task,
this is **not** the right place. In other words, you have to solve the
assignments yourselves beforing looking at someone else's full answers. Besides, I am not
resposible for your grade if you use this code.
